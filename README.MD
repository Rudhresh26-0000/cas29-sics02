## Abstract

This project focuses on the design and development of a drone capable of detecting healthy and diseased plants while providing related information to aid agricultural monitoring. The proposed drone integrates advanced image processing and sensor technologies for real-time data acquisition, analysis, and transmission. Initially, the drone is controlled using an Arduino microcontroller, with plans to upgrade to a flight controller for enhanced automation and remote operation in the future.

The drone is equipped with various sensors, including multispectral cameras for plant health assessment and environmental sensors to measure temperature and humidity. These features enable the drone to support precision agriculture by identifying diseased crops, monitoring field conditions, and providing actionable insights for farmers.

The development process includes hardware selection, software implementation for autonomous and manual control, and rigorous testing to ensure accuracy and reliability. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the system can classify plant health conditions effectively. The results demonstrate the drone’s potential as an efficient tool for modern agricultural practices, enhancing crop yield and disease management through real-time monitoring and data-driven decision-making.
